Description: Facets-bread collection of Hash-like classes.
 The Hashery is a collection of Hash-like classes, spun-off from the original
 Ruby Facets library. Included are the widely used OrderedHash, the related but
 more featured Dictionary class, a number of open classes, similiar to the
 standard OpenStruct and a few variations on the standard Hash.
